Daily boat tours around Lošinj offer visitors an accessible way to explore the surrounding islands and coastal landscapes. These tours typically include stops at places such as Susak, known for its sandy terrain; Unije, appreciated for its quiet bays; and Ilovik, a small island with lush vegetation and a charming village atmosphere. Depending on the operator, certain trips incorporate swimming breaks in secluded coves where the water is exceptionally clear.

Many tours include commentary about local history, maritime culture, and wildlife. Guides often share stories about the traditional lifestyles of Lošinj sailors and fishermen, as well as information about the protected bottlenose dolphins frequently spotted in the area. Operators sometimes adjust their routes when dolphins are seen nearby, allowing guests a chance to observe them respectfully.

Equipment such as snorkeling masks is commonly provided, enabling guests to explore underwater scenery. Some tours include simple refreshments—usually water, juice, or small snacks—while full-day excursions may offer a light lunch on board.

Tour durations vary, with half-day, full-day, and sunset options available. Sunset cruises are particularly popular for their scenic views and relaxed atmosphere. Boat tours are generally considered suitable for most age groups, including families with children, as boats usually offer shaded seating and stable ride conditions.
