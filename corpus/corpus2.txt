Hotel Aurora is a modern, wellness-oriented property located in a peaceful cove on Lošinj Island, surrounded by pine trees and overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The hotel combines contemporary architecture with a focus on natural materials that reflect the island’s landscape. Many rooms offer sea views, with balconies that allow guests to enjoy sunsets, fresh air, and the scent of Mediterranean herbs.

One of the hotel's central features is its extensive wellness center. The facility includes several types of saunas, such as Finnish, bio, and aromatic steam rooms inspired by the local herb tradition. Massage treatments are performed by certified therapists using oils derived from regional plants, including sage, lavender, and immortelle. Additional services include facial treatments, body wraps, hydrotherapy options, and a relaxation lounge with soft ambient lighting.

Guests can enjoy both indoor and outdoor pools. The outdoor pool area features multiple levels with sunbeds and shaded spaces, while the indoor pool is heated and designed for year-round use. A small fitness room is available for guests seeking light exercise during their stay. Wellness programs often incorporate gentle physical activities such as morning stretching, guided breathing exercises, and aromatherapy sessions.

Dining at Hotel Aurora emphasizes Mediterranean flavors with a focus on fresh ingredients. The main restaurant offers a buffet enriched with seasonal produce, fresh fish, and vegetarian choices. A smaller bar near the pool serves herbal teas crafted from Lošinj-grown plants and light snacks. Special themed dinners, such as “Herbal Evenings” or “Seafood Night,” are occasionally offered during the main season.

The hotel provides direct access to the beach, allowing guests to move seamlessly between wellness facilities and the sea. The nearby walking paths connect the hotel to the towns of Mali Lošinj and Veli Lošinj, making it convenient for guests to explore without the need for transportation.

Hotel Aurora is designed primarily for travelers who value comfort, relaxation, and holistic well-being. Its environment supports guests seeking recovery from stress, gentle physical activity, and a calm atmosphere.
